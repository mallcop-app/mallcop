// MultiConnector fans one scan cycle out over several sub-connectors and
// concatenates their events into a single batch. It is the seam that lets a
// config-driven `mallcop scan` pull from every configured source (file, github,
// decl, cloud, …) in ONE pass without the pipeline knowing more than one
// Connector exists.
//
// It carries NO source-specific logic — it only composes Connectors — so it
// stays inside the core/connect purity budget (stdlib + pkg/event; the
// core/lint import-lint stays green).
//
// Ordering: because the detector floor is whole-corpus (see connect.go), a scan
// depends on the SET of events, not their order across sources. MultiConnector
// therefore preserves each sub-connector's internal order and concatenates the
// batches in sub-connector declaration order — a deterministic, sufficient
// contract, with no streaming/interleaving guarantee.
//
// Fail-loud: if ANY sub-connector's Pull returns an error, MultiConnector's Pull
// returns that error and no events. A configured source that fails must HALT the
// scan — never silently under-report, which would tell the operator a source was
// scanned when it was not (the same posture as FileConnector's malformed-line
// error).

// source doing I/O aborts promptly. The first sub-connector error halts the
// scan and is returned as-is (no partial batch).
