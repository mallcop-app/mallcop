// Package router is the AUTONOMY ROUTER for mallcop's self-extension loop.
// Given a strict-parsed add-only proposal (from the proposer package) and
// the merged gate's verdict, it decides WHERE the proposal goes, enforcing the
// autonomy tiers (invariant 11) and the contribute-back consent rule (invariant
// 6):
//
//	FORBIDDEN         any consensus-bypass shape (force-escalate/family-match
//	                  rule, any narrowing, any GLOBAL suppress) — hard reject,
//	                  poison the fingerprint. Fail-safe, checked FIRST. NOT
//	                  gated by the autonomy dial — always rejected.
//	HUMAN-GATE        net-new event_type / net-new detector family / critical
//	                  severity / a committee-calibration knob / a non-GREEN
//	                  gate — a reviewable artifact, NEVER auto-applied. NOT
//	                  gated by the autonomy dial — always human, at every tier.
//	PENDING-APPROVAL  an otherwise-clean widen (would auto-route to
//	                  TENANT-OVERLAY) held for a human decision because the
//	                  AUTONOMY DIAL is "non" (propose-only).
//	                  Nothing is written — no overlay, no artifact.
//	TENANT-OVERLAY    data-only + additive + existing-vocab + GREEN gate with
//	                  coverage +1 and zero regression, AND the dial is "semi" or
//	                  "fully" — append-only into the CUSTOMER store overlay
//	                  (the DEFAULT auto-apply route for a clean widen at those
//	                  two tiers). Owner suppression is first-class here and
//	                  honored freely.
//	OSS-CONTRIB       ONLY with explicit per-build tenantConsent==true AND a
//	                  universally-applicable widen — emits an OSS-PR ARTIFACT
//	                  for human review; NEVER auto-pushes/merges, and the tenant
//	                  overlay is still written. Absent/unknown consent stays
//	                  overlay, FULL STOP (never confiscate or condition the fix
//	                  on consent). This tier is NOT gated by the autonomy dial —
//	                  contribute-back stays human/maintainer-reviewed
//	                  regardless of dial position (a hard line, not
//	                  operator-overridable).
//
// # Autonomy dial
//
// Router.Autonomy (autonomy.Dial) decides ONLY whether an
// otherwise-clean widen (FORBIDDEN/HUMAN-GATE-exempt, gate-GREEN) auto-applies
// to the tenant overlay: "non" holds it at PENDING-APPROVAL, "semi"/"fully"
// write it straight to TENANT-OVERLAY. It never affects FORBIDDEN, HUMAN-GATE,
// or OSS-CONTRIB — those are dial-independent by construction.
//
// # Anti-thrash
//
// A FORBIDDEN proposal poisons its fingerprint into the SHARED reject set
// (engine.RejectSet) the proposer consults first, so the same dead-end shape is
// never re-proposed. HUMAN-GATE, PENDING-APPROVAL, and the overlay/OSS routes
// do NOT poison — they are valid destinations, not rejections.
