// Package contribback opens the SECOND pull request in mallcop's self-extension
// loop. After a customer's OWN gated PR merges into their thin-embed repo, an
// OPTIONALLY-consented, universally-applicable widen may be proposed BACK to the
// shared OSS corpus (mallcop-app/mallcop) as a pull request the OSS project's own
// CI (exam.yml) and CODEOWNERS review gate. The router (the router package)
// already decides WHICH widens are OSS-eligible and emits a reviewable OSS-PR
// artifact for each; this package is the step that (opt-in) turns that artifact
// into an actual pull request.
//
// # Three hard invariants — none dial-overridable
//
//  1. OFF BY DEFAULT. The zero-value Config is disabled. Contribute-back never
//     runs unless the operator EXPLICITLY opts in (Config.Enabled). Building the
//     Opener, wiring the router, or handing it an artifact changes nothing on its
//     own — silence is the default.
//
//  2. OPERATOR IDENTITY, NO STANDING CREDENTIAL (design ruling R8). The PR is
//     opened under the OPERATOR's own gh credential, resolved at call time from
//     their ambient environment. The operator binary stores no machine-bot token
//     and holds no standing write credential to the shared repo. The Opener never
//     accepts, persists, or logs a token; PROpener implementations authenticate
//     entirely out-of-band (the operator's `gh auth`).
//
//  3. NEVER AUTO-MERGES AT ANY DIAL (design ruling R3, the contribute-back hard
//     line). This package has NO merge path — not a disabled one, not a
//     dial-gated one: none exists. The autonomy dial is accepted by Contribute
//     ONLY so the invariant is explicit and testable: every tier, INCLUDING the
//     most-autonomous "fully"/yolo setting, opens the PR and stops. Merging the
//     shared-OSS PR is the OSS maintainers' job, gated by OSS CI + review — it is
//     categorically outside this process's hands.
