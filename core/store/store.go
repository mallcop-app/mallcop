// Package store is the git-repo source of truth for mallcop's six append-only
// streams: events, findings, resolutions, baseline, conversation, and
// directives.
//
// ONE-BRAIN keystone. Every other core subsystem (the agent loop, the scan
// pipeline) CONSUMES this package; this package consumes nothing from them. The
// store has exactly one job: durably append records to a git repository such
// that the git repository ALONE can reconstruct the full state of the system.
// There is no separate database. The git history is the database.
//
// Each stream is a JSON-Lines file at the repo root (events.jsonl,
// findings.jsonl, …). Append serializes a record to one line, appends it to the
// stream file, stages, and commits. Reads replay the file. Because every write
// is a commit, `git log` is the audit trail and `git checkout <sha>` is
// time-travel.
//
// Directives and conversation are first-class streams, not afterthoughts. A
// directive written by one process (e.g. {"op":"suppress","pattern":"…"}) is
// loaded and obeyed by the next process that Opens the same repo — this is how
// an operator steers future scans. Conversation is the durable transcript that
// the agent loop appends to and replays.
//
// Concurrency model (OSS, single repo, no remote): a process-wide serialization
// hook guards the critical section, and every commit is performed on top of the
// current HEAD with a rebase-retry on the rare interleaving that still races.
// No write is ever lost; the merged log is deterministic (ordered by commit).
//
// IMPORT DISCIPLINE: this package imports NO channel, campfire, inference, or
// connect packages. It is the bottom of the dependency graph. See
// imports_test.go, which fails the build if that ever changes.

// per Append call". It stops being fine when a caller drives thousands of
// Appends back to back (a scan ingesting a large connector pull): the cost of
// N single-record commits against a stream of size F is O(N * F), because
// each commit re-hashes the (growing) whole file. In production this produced
// thousands of commits per scan, each writing a multi-MB blob into the object
// store — tens of gigabytes of loose-object churn that exhausted CI runner
// disk (mallcoppro-ee3). AppendBatch collapses the whole batch into ONE
// commitAppend call — one blob re-hash, one commit — so the cost for a
// same-size batch drops to O(F) regardless of N.
//
// ATOMICITY CONTRACT: AppendBatch is all-or-nothing. Every record is
// marshaled and JSONL-validated (one record, no bare newline) BEFORE the
// Serializer lock is acquired and before anything is written to the object
// store. If any record at index k fails to marshal or contains a newline, the
// WHOLE batch is rejected with an error naming index k, and NOTHING is
// committed — not even the records before k. Once validation passes, the
// batch is committed as a single atomic commitAppend call: there is no
// intermediate state where only part of the batch has landed.
//
// EMPTY BATCH: len(records) == 0 is a documented no-op. It returns ("", nil)
// without taking the Serializer lock or creating a commit — there is nothing
// to append, so there is nothing to charge a commit for.

// scopes per-tenant rather than per-repo) WITHOUT relying on the shared work
// tree or index at all.
//
// A naive "append to the work-tree file, then git add && git commit" is unsafe
// under true concurrency: two processes share one work tree and one index.lock,
// so their file appends and commits interleave into lost writes, duplicated
// records, or hard "File exists" failures. We sidestep the work tree entirely
// and operate on the git OBJECT STORE with plumbing:
//
//  1. Read the current HEAD (oldHead) and the committed content of the stream
//     blob at HEAD.
//  2. Append our chunk (one or more already newline-terminated JSONL lines)
//     to that content in memory and write a NEW BLOB (git hash-object -w).
//  3. Build a NEW TREE from HEAD's tree with our blob swapped in
//     (read-tree + update-index in a TEMPORARY, per-attempt index file — never
//     the shared index — then write-tree).
//  4. Create the commit (git commit-tree -p oldHead).
//  5. Atomically advance the ref: git update-ref HEAD <newCommit> <oldHead>.
//     This is a COMPARE-AND-SWAP — it fails iff HEAD moved since step 1. On
//     failure we loop (rebase onto the new tip). On success our write is the
//     unique child of oldHead.
//
// Because the CAS rejects any commit whose expected-old-value is stale, no
// concurrent writer can be overwritten: every winner advances HEAD by exactly
// one commit, every loser retries against the new HEAD. The result is a linear,
// deterministic, commit-ordered log with NO lost write and NO duplicate, proven
// by TestRebaseRetryUnderTrueRace.
//
// Steps 1-5 above deliberately never touch the repo's REAL index/work tree —
// only the CAS winner's per-attempt temp index. Once the CAS lands, the
// winner reconciles the real index/work tree to HEAD (syncWorkTree) so the

// `git status` sees every stream file as staged-deleted (mallcoppro-4fe).
