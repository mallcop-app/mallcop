// Package pipeline is the ORCHESTRATOR that assembles the four core seams into
// one agentic scan cycle:
//
//	core/connect  →  core/detect  →  core/agent (cascade)  →  core/store
//	  (Pull)          (Detect)        (ResolveFinding)         (Append)
//
// Run is the single entry point. It pulls events through a Connector, runs the
// deterministic detector floor, then resolves EACH finding through the tiered
// triage→investigate→escalate cascade (core/agent.ResolveFindingWith), and
// durably appends both the findings and their resolutions to the git-backed
// store. It returns a Summary of what happened.
//
// CONCURRENCY: findings are resolved through a bounded worker pool (Config.Workers,
// default modest). This is safe because the two shared collaborators are
// concurrency-safe by construction:
//
//   - the inference client (core/agent.Client, in practice inference.DirectClient)
//     is a stateless net/http POSTer — every Messages call builds its own request;
//     there is no shared mutable state, so N goroutines may call it at once.
//   - the store serializes every Append behind its per-repo Serializer lock and a
//     git compare-and-swap, so concurrent appends linearize with no lost write.
//
// The pipeline adds NOTHING to that floor: it never bypasses the cascade (the
// untrusted-data handling, the hard-constraint floor, the structural gate, and
// the fail-safe all live INSIDE ResolveFindingWith — the pipeline calls it and
// honors whatever it returns). A finding the floor force-escalates never reaches
// the model; a finding the cascade escalates is recorded as escalated; the
// pipeline cannot and does not re-decide.
//
// IMPORT DISCIPLINE: this package imports core/connect, core/detect, core/agent,
// core/store, and pkg/* — and NOTHING that talks to a model directly. It reaches
// inference ONLY through the core/agent.Client interface threaded in by the
// caller (the cmd layer hands it an inference.DirectClient). The core import-lint
// (core/lint) and this package's imports_test.go forbid any framework / transport
// / vendor-SDK import here.
